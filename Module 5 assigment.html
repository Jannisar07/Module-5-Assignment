     <strong> Answer</strong> With the help of audio and vedio tag we can provide any kind of audio and vedio in our webpage. <br>
     following are the steps by which we can embed audio and vedio in your webpage: <br>
     <strong> 1. Audio Syntax: </strong><br>
    
           &lt;audio &gt; <br>
            &lt;   source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type" &gt; <br>

         &lt;  source src="file_name" type="video_file_type"  &gt; <br>
         &lt;/vedio &gt; <br>
         <strong> Attributes of  &lt; vedio &gt; tag:</strong> <br>
         i. autoplay-  When the page is loaded. It specifies to play audio as soon as possible. <br>
         ii. controls- It displays audio control. <br>
         iii. loop- 	It will start the audio again when it is finished. <br>

     <h2> Q-3. Semantic element in HTML5?  </h2>
     <strong> Answer</strong> A semantic element clearly explains its meaning to both the browser and the developer. In simple words for Eg. Non-semantic elements include &lt;div &gt; and &lt; span &gt; which do not tell about the content where as 
     &lt; Form &gt;, &lt; table &gt;, and &lt;article &gt; are examples of semantic elements. which clearly tells about the content. <br>
     Various  semantic elements are as fellows: <br>
     1.  &lt; article &gt; <br>

      <!--Question 4-->
     <h2> Q-4 Canvas and SVG tags  </h2>
     <strong> Answer</strong>  SVG is an XML-based language for describing 2D graphics. <br>

     Canvas generates 2D graphics on the fly (using JavaScript). <br>
     
     Because SVG is built on XML, every element is accessible through the SVG DOM. JavaScript event handlers can be attached to an element. <br>
     
     Each rendered shape is remembered as an object in SVG. If an SVG object's attributes are modified, the browser can automatically re-render the shape. <br>
     
     Canvas is drawn pixel by pixel. The browser forgets about the graphic once it is drawn on canvas. If its position is altered, the entire scene must be recreated, including any items that may have been obscured by the image. <br>
     <Strong>Basics difference between svg and canvas tags</Strong> <br>
     <strong> i. Canvas</strong> <br>
     <ul>
       <li> Depending on the resolution </li>
<li>There is no support for event handlers.</li>
<li>Text rendering capabilities are inadequate.</li>
<li>The final image can be saved as.png or.jpg and is ideal for graphic-intensive games. </li>
     </ul>

     <strong> ii. SVG </strong> <br>
     <ul>
       <li> Resolution independent </li>
<li>Support for event handler    .</li>
<li>Ideal for applications with huge rendering areas (e.g., Google Maps).</li>
<li>Not suitable for gaming purposes </li>
     </ul> <br>
